## 2025-04-10 - [API Authentication and Error Sanitization]
**Vulnerability:** The API was completely unauthenticated, allowing anyone with the URL to read, write, and delete workout data. Additionally, error messages leaked database internal details.
**Learning:** Hardcoded hashes in the frontend do not provide server-side security. Authentication must be enforced at the API layer.
**Prevention:** Use server-side secrets for authentication and ensure catch blocks do not return raw error objects or messages to the client.
